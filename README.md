# Installation

Copy the files from the repo (don't actually clone it) and move them to your new
repo's location.  From here, add your git remote origin to start a new python
package.

Activate a python virtual environment and install the repo by running the
following command in the repo's root folder:

```python
pip install .
```

Now to run the included bin script, you can simply run the following from the
command line:

```
sample_script --verbose
```

Unit Tests can be run with:
```
python -m unittest
```
